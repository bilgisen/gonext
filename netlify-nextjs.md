description: "Learn about Next.js on our platform. Use App Router, automatic fine-grained caching, image optimization, and more with Next.js 13.5+ on Netlify."

Netlify supports all major Next.js features with zero configuration, via our open-source [OpenNext adapter](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-netlify). This adapter is thoroughly tested with every Next.js release.

For Next.js versions prior to 13.5, visit the [legacy runtime](/build/frameworks/framework-setup-guides/nextjs/legacy-runtime/overview) page.

## Get started

If you have an existing Next.js app you'd like to deploy, push your code to a Git provider and connect it through the Netlify Dashboard.

When starting from scratch, the fastest way is to deploy our [Next.js platform starter template](https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-platform-starter) to your Netlify account.

## Key features

 - **App Router:** Netlify fully supports the Next.js App Router, which supports more powerful nested layouts and React's latest features, such as Server Components and Streaming.

 - **Automatic fine-grained caching:** the adapter uses our [fine-grained caching primitives](/start/core-concepts/primitives#fine-grained-cache-control) to support the Next.js Full Route Cache and Data Cache. This means that static page responses are automatically cached at the edge and can be revalidated by path or by tag.

 - **On-demand and time-based revalidation:** both the App Router and Pages Router support on-demand and time-based revalidation, allowing you to revalidate and regenerate content at any time after a deploy.

 - **Image optimization:** the `next/image` component uses [Netlify Image CDN](/build/image-cdn/overview ) by default, to ensure your images are optimized and served in the most efficient format.

 - **Skew protection:** Netlify fully supports skew protection, to mitigate client-side errors for site visitors who are active when a new deployment goes live.

## Next.js support on Netlify

The following tables show you a comprehensive mapping of critical Next.js features and how Netlify supports them. Netlify supports new Next.js features as early as possible, but experimental features may not be fully stable yet.

### How Netlify runs your Next.js app

Netlify automatically configures your project to support modern Next.js features out of the box. This is powered by our OpenNext adapter, an open source project that provisions the correct infrastructure for each part of your Next.js application without custom configuration.

We recommend that you don't pin the adapter version. We actively maintain the adapter to support all Next.js versions starting from version 13.5 and, if you don't pin the version, we will automatically update the adapter to the latest version on each project build for you.

#### What the adapter does

When you deploy a Next.js project on Netlify, the adapter automatically:

- Provisions a serverless Netlify Function for handling: Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), Partial Prerendering (PPR), Route handlers or API routes, and Server Actions.

- Provisions a Netlify Edge function for fast execution of Next.js Middleware at the edge.

- Configures the caching implementation for both the Next.js Full Route Cache and Data Cache, and handles tag-based and path-based revalidation.

- Enables image optimization with the Netlify Image CDN and `next/image`.

#### Compatibility and testing

We verify compatibility with every new stable version of Next.js. Each release of the adapter is tested using:

- Our official end-to-end test suite.
- Additional integration tests with Netlify's platform.
- Real-world deploys that we maintain.

## Skew protection

Each build of a Next.js site generates asset files (such as JavaScript bundles and CSS files). These files are automatically named with a unique hash derived from the build and file contents.

Additionally, the new deployment often comes with modified server-side code (e.g., React Server Components, Server Actions, Route handlers, etc.).

If a new production deployment goes live while visitors are in the middle of a session, it can cause several subtle issues:

- **Static asset 404s:** When navigating between pages, the client requests additional JavaScript bundles using identifiers that were provided with the initially loaded page. If those bundles no longer exist, the requests fail.

- **Failures on server-side calls:** Navigation, form submissions, and other dynamic features often fetch or post data. If responses rely on updated code that structures output differently, expects different inputs, or uses renamed paths, it can trigger unexpected browser errors.

These issues are difficult to consistently reason about and prevent without coordinated support from both the web framework and the deployment platform.

### How skew protection works

Skew protection addresses these challenges by synchronizing client requests with the correct deployment:

- Each page load includes a unique deployment identifier.
- Next.js appends this identifier to subsequent client requests during navigation (until the next full page reload).
- Netlify CDN detects the given identifier and serves responses from the matching deployment - whether the current one or a previous one.

### Enabling skew protection

Skew protection is **an opt-in feature**. To enable it:

1. Add an [environment variable](/build/environment-variables/overview) to your project configuration. Set the variable name to `NETLIFY_NEXT_SKEW_PROTECTION` and its value to `true`.

2. If you're using a Next.js version _earlier than 14.1.4_, you also need to include the following flags in your `next.config.js` file:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    useDeploymentId: true,
    // Optionally, use with Server Actions
    useDeploymentIdServerActions: true,
  },
};
```

3. Redeploy your project for the changes to take effect.

### Limitations of skew protection

- **No CLI deploy support:** Skew protection is not supported when deploying directly from the CLI.

- **No automatic support for fetch calls:** Next.js does not automatically add the deployment identifier to explicit `fetch` calls on the client. If you use `fetch` to call a route handler (or an API Route if using the Pages Router), the request is always served by the current deployment.

To adjust this behavior, you have two options:

1. Next.js 15.4.0 introduced a [new experimental feature](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/78841) to handle these cases. Netlify supports this feature. However, that feature is not yet production-ready.
2. Alternatively, you can direct specific `fetch` calls to the correct deployment by adding a header:
```js
fetch('/path', {
  headers: {
    'x-deployment-id': process.env.NEXT_DEPLOYMENT_ID
  },
});
```
Netlify detects this header and will rewrite the request to the correct deployment.

## Reverting to an older adapter version

### Caution - Not recommended

We recommend that you don't pin the adapter version. We actively maintain the adapter to support all Next.js versions starting from version 13.5 and, if you don't pin the version, we will automatically use the latest version on each project build for you.

To pin a specific version of the adapter:

1. Install the version you want in `package.json`:

    ```sh
    npm install @netlify/plugin-nextjs@<version>
    ```

2. Add the plugin to your `netlify.toml`:

    ```toml
    [[plugins]]
    package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
    ```

You'll be opting out of automatic updates and newer architecture improvements maintained through OpenNext. To opt back in, remove `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` from your `package.json`.

## Limitations

Open issues are documented in the [end-to-end test report page](https://runtime-e2e-report.netlify.app/).

- **Edge Runtime Support:** SSR pages using the edge runtime run in your functions region with the Node.js runtime, rather than in edge locations. No functionality is missing.
- **Rewrite Limitations:** Rewrites in Next.js configuration can't point to static files in the public directory.
- **Middleware Execution Order:** Headers and redirects are evaluated after middleware, differing from stand-alone Next.js behavior.
- **Node.js Middleware:**
  - [C++ Addons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) are not supported,
  - [Filesystem](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) is not supported.
- **Forms Integration:** Netlify Forms requires additional code when used with Next.js applications. [Learn more.](https://opennext.js.org/netlify/forms)
