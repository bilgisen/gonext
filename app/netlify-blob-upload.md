Serving user-generated uploads using Netlify Blobs
by Sean C Davis

Netlify Blobs provide a powerful way to read and write unstructured data in a key-value format. Because the value of a blob can be any type of data, we can use blobs beyond typical KV store scenarios.

#TL;DR
We’re going to walk through the basics of using Netlify Blobs to allow users to upload images to your site. After we cover the basic steps, we’ll talk more specifically about how this applies to the example site.

Demo time!
This guide walks through the general process with loose references to the demo site. If you’d like to see the full code, visit our examples repository.

Or you can deploy the demo site to your own Netlify account by clicking the button below.

#Applying to any framework
Technically, this pattern can be accomplished using static HTML files and Netlify Functions.

Because of that, there is no specific framework (or set of frameworks) for which this guide is intended. You can take the principles and apply them to any framework you choose.

#Requirements
There are two requirements for this guide:

Install @netlify/blobs to be able to access the Netlify Blobs API from your code.
Use Netlify Dev to ensure that the serverless functions and blobs store work in your local development environment.
#Uploading images to Netlify Blobs
First, let’s build the process for uploading a file and storing it in a Netlify Blob.

#Upload file form
On the page where the user can upload an image, add a form to upload a file. The form should include an input field of type file and a submit button.

<form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="fileUpload" accept="image/*" style="margin-top: 1rem;" />
  <div>
    <input type="submit" value="Upload avatar" />
  </div>
</form>

Notice that the form’s action is /upload. This is where we’ll send the file to be processed.

#The upload endpoint
Add your endpoint file to handle the POST request to /upload. Without a framework, this can be done with a serverless function and a redirect, where /upload redirects to /.netlify/functions/<your-function-name>.

Here is the basic shape to a function that handles the file upload:

import { getStore } from "@netlify/blobs";

export async function uploadEndpoint({ request }) {
  // Get form data from the request (assumes that `request` is the incoming
  // request object)
  const formData = await request.formData();
  // Get the file from the form data
  const fileUpload = formData.get("fileUpload") as File;
  // Load the Netlify Blobs store called `UserUpload`
  const userUploadStore = getStore({ name: "UserUpload", consistency: "strong" });
  // Set the file in the store. Replace `<key>` with a unique key for the file.
  await userUploadStore.set("<key>", fileUpload);
  // Redirect to a new page
  return redirect("<redirect_path>");
}

A few notes about the function above:

Each blobs store has a name. This is typically used to group blobs together.
The consistency option is set to "strong". Blobs use eventual consistency by default. We set it to strong so that the upload is immediately available when replacing the image under the same key.
The <key> in the set method should be a unique identifier for the file. This could be a UUID or a hash of the file contents. It should be a value by which you can retrieve the file later.
#Displaying the image
To display the image, we take a similar approach. We can use a server-side function to retrieve the image and serve it to the client.

#Retrieval function
Similar to uploading, you can add another function or endpoint for retrieving the image. This function will read the blob from the store and return it to the client.

import { getStore } from "@netlify/blobs";

export async function uploadEndpoint() {
  // Load the Netlify Blobs store called `UserUpload`
  const userUploadStore = getStore({ name: "UserUpload", consistency: "strong" });
  // Get the blob from the store. Replace `<key>` with the unique key used when
  // uploading.
  const userUploadBlob = await userUploadStore.get("<key>", {
    type: "stream",
  });
  // Make sure you throw a 404 if the blob is not found.
  if (!userUploadBlob) {
    return new Response("Upload not found", { status: 404 });
  }
  // Return the blob
  return new Response(userUploadBlob);
}

#Handling dynamic paths
In most cases, you won’t be hard-coding the key for the image upload in the function. Instead, you’ll likely want to get this through GET parameters or some other dynamic method, depending on the framework you’re using.

#Image markup
Because this function returns the image as a stream, you can use it directly in an img tag.

<img src="<path-to-function>" alt="<alt-text>" />

#Using JS for a fallback
If you’re using the image tag, you want to ensure you have some confidence that the image exists. Otherwise, you’ll render a broken image.

A common pattern is to have a reference to the image in your data store to ensure it’s there, and then conditionally render the image.

But that isn’t always a practical approach. Fortunately, you can use just a bit of JavaScript to add a class to the image if it fails to load.

<img src="<path-to-function>" class="my-image" onerror="this.classList.add('missing-upload')" />

#User-generated uploads for avatar images
That’s it! This is a basic and generic pattern for uploading and displaying images using Netlify Blobs. You can extend this pattern to any scenario where you need to store and retrieve images.

The example application is an Astro site that allows users to upload an avatar image. The application includes a mock authentication service to simulate the user’s identity.

Let’s wrap up by briefly looking at how the example project works.

#Mock auth service
A mock authentication service simulates the user’s identity with this flow:

The app has a /profile page that does not show any information when the user is not authenticated, but provides a link to the /login page.
Visiting the /login page looks for the current user. If it doesn’t find one, it mocks a user by creating a random email, name, and ID value.
The user’s information is stored in a server cookie.
The /profile page then reads the cookie to determine if the user is authenticated.
#Uploading avatar images
Once a user is authenticated, they can access the upload form on the /profile page. The form follows the pattern above by sending a POST request to an /upload-avatar endpoint.

The endpoint gets transformed into a serverless function during the build. It uses the @netlify/blobs package to store the image in a blobs store, and uses the user ID value as the key for the image.

#Displaying the avatar
In the example, we only display the current user’s avatar. For that reason, we have a single /avatar endpoint that is responsible for retrieving the image. It uses the current user’s ID to retrieve the image from the blobs store.

Then, anywhere on the site, we can show the user’s avatar by using the /avatar endpoint as the src value.

<img src="/avatar" class="avatar" onerror="this.parentElement.classList.add('missing-upload')" />

Notice that if the image is missing, this code adds a class to the parent element. This is used to style the image differently if it is missing.
